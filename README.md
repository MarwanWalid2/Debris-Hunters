# Summry
Utilizing Unity’s 2D game engine, we built a fun and educational video game to teach players space exploration and its challenges. Players explore space by jumping on platforms and trying their best not to fall. As they advance, they reach farther celestial destinations, starting from the ISS to the Moon to the rest of the solar system and beyond. At each celestial object the player visits, info on the object and challenges astronauts might face during exploration (i.e., lack of navigational aids and delayed communications) will be displayed. Our project is important as it can be enjoyed by all age groups, but it’s essential for educating generations about space travel and its challenges.

# Detailed Project Description
Inspired by our most beloved childhood game, Icy Tower, we developed an exciting 2D plat-former game. As players jump from platform to platform, they reach higher elevations and are able to view far-fetched celestial bodied, where they can explore these objects, learn about their origins, and understand the potential hazards and challenges awaiting our future astronauts during space travel.  

Players are also able to collect space debris as they rise through the platforms, which is turned into in-game currency depending on how much debris they collected. This in-game currency can be used to buy upgrades, cosmetics, or mystery destination cards—cards that teleport the user to mystery celestial bodies like asteroids, Trans Neptunian Objects, and even further out in the Oort cloud and exoplanets. 

Since space exploration is quite an uncommon concept for most people, we hoped to educate people about it through an immersive, fun, and educational video game. To create the game, we used Unity’s game engine for its availability and accessibility, with the main coding language being C#. Additionally, Adobe illustrator was used to create of the in-game designs (background, characters, platforms, etc.).

# Space Agency Data
NASA’s organized resources greatly helped us in the process of data collection. Our data collection has been all written based on factual data released by NASA. The data provided by the Space Agency allowed us to give orbiting satellites in our game accurate locations and names. Using Unity Game engine, we were able to accurately name some of these Satellites. This influenced us to plan and hopefully include data regarding these satellites if hit by the player. Furthermore, as the players reach further destination in the space, they will find stellar phenomenon explained sufficiently appear on the screen; for example, as players reach level one, they will find the moon with a click button to show information about it: its history, hazards, and dangers faced people tried to land on it. 

Moreover, as the levels increase and the players reach higher ranks, the player will see info about more advanced celestial beings and the challenges astronauts might face during exploration of Space (i.e., lack of navigational aids and delayed communications). Also, included in our game is an info section were players can learn more about space debris and their harmful effect on space exploration. This info was also collected through multiples websites (including NASA’s website) and can help inform people of the serious debris problem. Because the players will comprehend the space debris problem as demonstrated at NASA Space Agency’s website, this section also encourages players to think of creative ways to solve this problem.
